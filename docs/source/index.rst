Welcome to Tik Manager4 Documentation!
=======================================

**Tik Manager** is a Python-based Pipeline and Project Management platform designed for VFX and Animation Projects.

The primary objective of Tik Manager 4 is to maintain simplicity for small projects while offering the flexibility needed to handle more complex and larger-scale endeavors.

As with its predecessor, Tik Manager v4 remains cross-platform and cross-DCC (Digital Content Creation).

Why Tik Manager?
------------------------------------

**Efficiency**

A well-designed pipeline streamlines the workflow by automating repetitive tasks, managing data flow, and standardizing procedures. This efficiency allows the team to focus more on creative aspects rather than dealing with technicalities.

**Collaboration**

VFX projects often involve multiple team members working on different aspects simultaneously. Tik Manager provides a centralized platform where team members can collaborate, share assets, and track progress. This ensures everyone is on the same page and reduces the chances of errors due to miscommunication.

**Version Control**

With numerous iterations and revisions during the production process, it's crucial to have a system in place for version control. Tik Manager helps manage different versions of assets and tracks changes, ensuring that the latest versions are always accessible and that previous versions can be retrieved if needed.

**Asset Management**

VFX projects involve a multitude of assets such as 3D models, textures, rigs, animations, etc. Tik Manager organizes these assets in a structured manner, making them easily searchable and retrievable. This saves time and prevents assets from being misplaced or lost.

**Scalability**

As VFX projects vary in scale and complexity, a Tik Manager allows for scalability, adapting to the specific needs of each project. Whether it's a personal weekend project or a an episodic series with hundreds of shots and sequences, Tik Manager can accommodate the requirements and scale accordingly.

**Risk Management**

By enforcing standards and best practices, Tik Manager helps mitigate risks associated with project delays, budget overruns, and quality issues. It provides a structured framework for project management, reducing the likelihood of costly mistakes.

**Open Source**

Tik Manager is open-source, meaning it's free to use and can be customized to suit individual requirements. The community can contribute to its development, and it can be adapted to meet the specific needs of different projects.
