Developers Guide
================

No two pipelines are identical. The ability to add custom extractors, ingestors, and validators is one of the 
most powerful features of Tik Manager. By incorporating customized logic into your pipeline, 
you can automate repetitive tasks and uphold your studio's standards.

There are essential guidelines that Technical Directors (TDs) should adhere to when developing these integrations. 
These rules are applicable across all DCCs (Digital Content Creation tools). 
When followed diligently, any logic can be seamlessly integrated into Tik Manager.
