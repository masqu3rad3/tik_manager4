Tik Manager is designed with flexibility at its core. It adapts to the diverse needs of teams, from solo artists to large-scale productions, thanks to its modular plugin-based system. Whether you are working locally or remotely, with a static or dynamic team structure, Tik Manager4 provides a scalable foundation for your pipeline.

Workflows in Tik Manager are shaped by several key factors and follow a common baseline setup process. This page outlines the foundational steps every workflow shares and provides guidance on how to adapt them to your specific project setup.

Workflow Factors
----------------
----------------
Before setting up a project, consider the following parameters. These will influence how you configure your project in Tik Manager:

**Team Size:**
Is the project handled by a single person or a larger team? Smaller teams may benefit from a lightweight setup, while larger teams may require stricter validation and review procedures.

**Remote or Local:**
For remote teams, it’s crucial to have a well-structured common folder accessible via the cloud or synchronized through network drives.

**Project Size:**
Larger projects will benefit from well-defined task categories and metadata schemas, while smaller or experimental projects can be more minimal.

**Pipeline Resources:**
Does the project have dedicated pipeline developers or technical artists? If not, it’s essential to lean on defaults and templates that work out-of-the-box.

**Project Evolution:**
Will the project scale significantly? Preparing your categories and metadata with extensibility in mind will prevent bottlenecks later on.
